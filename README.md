Hi, I'm Brandon Osuji. Welcome to my repository.

I've been developing and designing since my softmore year in highschool, I graduated in 2008.

I finally took on the role as a 'joomla developer' at my first 'developer/programmer' job....

4 days later I finally took on the role as a FIRED 'joomla developer' REASON....'12$/hr pretending to be a web developer without writing a single line of code'

....WTF..?

Check out my work and hopefully you find some interest in my work.
